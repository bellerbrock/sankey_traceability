# sankey_traceability
A repo to host example sankey traceability visualizations for breeding data.

[Demo 1](https://bl.ocks.org/bellerbrock/437279e9f6e04102a1b5f9d8d6abd7c2)

Inspired by a desire for big-picture visualizations of complex breeding program processes. Encouraged by similar ideas discussed [here](https://github.com/solgenomics/sgn/issues/1817). Uses [d3-sankey-diagram](https://github.com/ricklupton/d3-sankey-diagram) along with fake breeding data.
