# sankey_traceability
A repo to host example sankey traceability visualizations for breeding data.

Inspired by a desire for big-picture visualations of complex breeding program process. Encouraged by similar ideas discussed [here](https://github.com/solgenomics/sgn/issues/1817). Will use [d3-sankey-diagram](https://github.com/ricklupton/d3-sankey-diagram) along with fake breeding data.
